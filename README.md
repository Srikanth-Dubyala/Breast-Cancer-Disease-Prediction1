# Breast-Cancer-Disease-Prediction1

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on predictinG the women is having Breast Cancer or not  using different machine learning models. The notebook includes data preprocessing,exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training/evaluation.  

##  Model Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Results
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) ACCURACY : 98.2%
- Performed Hyperparameter tuning GridSearch CV
##  Future Improvements
  Deploy as a Streamlit/Flask web application
  - - Try deep learning ( ANN)
